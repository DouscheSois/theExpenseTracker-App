<h2>Summary</h2>

I've always wanted to learn React because it's attractive. I also wanted to learn how to use React hooks and the contextAPI for state management. This ExpenseTracker App is a good way to practice what I have been reading online (React Hooks, ContextAPI, Props & Components) on the React Doc. Webpage.
