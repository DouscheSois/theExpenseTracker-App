<h2>Summary</h2>

I've always wanted to learn React because of its popularity and functionality. I wanted to learn how to use React hooks and the contextAPI for state management more specifically. This ExpenseTracker App is a good way to practice the basics of what I have been reading online so far (React Hooks, ContextAPI, Props & Components) on the React Doc. Webpage and other sources.
