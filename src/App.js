//Figure it out, how the fuck to render it to the dom in table mode setting style with a delete button.

// Each expense should include:

// The date of expense
// A description of the expense
// The amount
// Where the purchases occured (eg. McDonaldâ€™s)

// User should be able to add a new expense
// User should be able to delete expense
// User should be able to see all of the expenses in an HTML table
